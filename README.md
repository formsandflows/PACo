# PACo
PACo is a Power Apps canvas app containing many canvas components to create functional and good-looking canvas apps in less time.

The screenshot below is made from the companion canvas app [PACoCo](.\PACoCo.md) which is created with PACo.

# Components

Each canvas component belongs to a category and has its own documentation file. The documentation is always based on the most recent final version of that canvas component.

The canvas components have been made with being used in responsive canvas apps in mind.

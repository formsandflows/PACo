**2023-05-03: Version 2.0 - The responsive version - has been released!**

# PACo
PACo consists of two Power Apps canvas apps containing many canvas components to create functional and good-looking canvas apps in less time:
- PACo-Core
  - The main canvas components.
- PACo-Extra
  - Additional canvas components which can also be used and useful without the core canvas components.

Do more in less time was one of the drivers for this project. No premium Power Apps license is needed to use PACo.

The canvas components contain several settings – dependent on the canvas component – to adjust them to your own needs. Because it are canvas components, you can even make changes to the canvas components with your existing Power Apps knowledge.

The screenshot below is made from the companion canvas app [PACoCo](./Documentation/PACoCo.md) which is created with PACo canvas components.

To be able to use PACo canvas components, two experimental features must be enabled:

- Enhanced component properties (In preview since 2021-02-18)
- ParseJSON function and untyped objects (In preview since 2022-09-12)
  - This feature is not needed when the form canvas component is not used. The form canvas component is still under development. It is included but not documented.

Please also look at the [Power Platform Creator Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/creator-kit/overview) if you are interested in creating functional and good-looking apps (model-driven and canvas) in less time. The creator kit has many really nice code- and canvas components. It requires an environment with a database and to be able to use code components.

The installation of PACo and PACoCo is described [here](./Documentation/Installation.md).

How to update PACo canvas components in your canvas apps is described [here](./Documentation/How%20to%20update%20PACo%20canvas%20components.md).

How to add the PACo canvas components to your canvas app for this first time is described [here](./Documentation/How%20to%20add%20PACo%20canvas%20components%20to%20your%20canvas%20app%20for%20the%20first%20time.md).

The backlog of PACo is [here](https://www.formsandflows.nl/paco-backlog/).

I very much appreciate it if you sent me a message how you use PACo canvas components. [This](https://www.formsandflows.nl/using-paco/) form can be used for that. Thank you!

PACo is a set of **37** canvas components to create functional and good-looking canvas apps in less time. No premium Power Apps license is needed and it is offered under the MIT license.

Main features of **PACo** are:
* Regular and hotfix releases.
* Extended documentation.
* Two supporting canvas apps:
  * **PACo - Copy from** to simplify using PACo canvas components.
    * This is a new canvas app from version 4.0.0.
  * **PACo - Examples** to demonstrate the canvas components.
    * TThis app in included in version 3.4.0 but not in version 4.0.0. It will be added again in version 4.1.0.
* GitHub issues to report an issue.
* Proven and very configurable canvas components.
* Responsiveness.
* Designed for a multi-language implementation.
  * Multi-language is optional.

Below is a screenshot of a canvas app screen using 6 canvas components.

Creating quality and meaningful canvas components is the main goal of **PACo**.

**PACo** is added with a Power Platform solution (managed or unmanaged) and consists of the main objects:
* The component library **PACo** containing all canvas components.
* The supporting canvas app **PACo ‚Äì Copy from** which contains a screen for each canvas component. In this canvas app, all canvas components have global variables/expressions for their custom properties. This greatly simplifies using PACo canvas components when copying PACo canvas components from this supporting canvas app.
* The supporting canvas app **PACo Examples** which contains a screen for each canvas component or set of related canvas components. This canvas app makes it easy to experiment with the canvas components and so better understand them.

If **PACo** is useful to you, I would very much appreciate it if you bought me a coffee: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker) üëç

And with that, I wish you a lot of fun creating your business solutions with the Microsoft Power Platform and of course also with **PACo** üòÅüëä

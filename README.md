  * "PACo ‚Äì Copy from" to simplify using PACo canvas components.
  * "PACo ‚Äì Demo" to demonstrate an implementation of each canvas component.
  * "PACo ‚Äì Demo app" to demonstrate how a set of 12 PACo canvas apps can work together to create a responsive (from web to mobile) canvas app.
* Extended documentation.
* Regular and hotfix releases.
* GitHub issues to report an issue.
* Responsiveness.
* Multi-language support.

Creating high-quality and meaningful canvas components is one of the goals of PACo.

PACo is added with a Power Platform solution (both a managed and unmanaged solution are provided) and consists of the following objects:
* The component library "PACo" containing all canvas components.
* The supporting canvas apps.

Each canvas component has a content page which can be found on the content page: [https://www.formsandflows.nl/paco/cc](https://www.formsandflows.nl/paco/cc)

Links to general content pages can be found on the content page: [https://www.formsandflows.nl/paco/documentation](https://www.formsandflows.nl/paco/documentation)

The releases and release notes can be found on this GitHub repository.

If PACo is useful to you, I would very much appreciate it if you bought me a coffee: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker) üëç

And with that, I wish you a lot of fun creating your business solutions with the Microsoft Power Platform and of course also with PACo üëä

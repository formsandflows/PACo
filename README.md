Creating quality and meaningful canvas components is one of the goals of PACo.

**PACo** is added with a Power Platform solution (managed or unmanaged) which consists of the objects:
* The component library **PACo** containing all canvas components.
* The canvas app **[PACo Examples](https://www.formsandflows.nl/redirects/paco-github-paco-examples)** which contains a screen for each canvas component or set of related canvas components. This canvas app makes it easy to experiment with the canvas components and so better understand them.
* The canvas app **[PACoCo](https://www.formsandflows.nl/redirects/paco-github-pacoco)** which is a responsive canvas app to demonstrate how several canvas components work together. A screenshot of the home screen is shown above.

Each canvas component has a documentation page which can be found in the folder "Canvas components".

Links to general documentation can be found [here](https://www.formsandflows.nl/redirects/paco-github-documentation).

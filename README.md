**2023-07-02: [Version 2.2](./Releases/Release%20notes.md) has been released!**

# PACo
PACo is a set of many canvas components to create functional and good-looking canvas apps in less time. No premium Power Apps license or Dataverse is needed to use PACo.

The PACo canvas components contain several settings – dependent on the component – to adjust them to your own needs. Because it are canvas components, you can even make changes to the PACo canvas components with your existing Power Apps knowledge.

4 canvas apps are included:
- [PACo-Core](./Components/Core)
  - The main PACo canvas components.
- [PACo-Extra](./Components/Extra)
  - Additional PACo canvas components which can also be used independently of the core PACo canvas components.
- [PACoCo](./Documentation/PACoCo.md)
  - The companion canvas app to demonstrate how several PACo canvas components can be used together.
  - The screenshot above is made from this companion canvas app.
- [PACo Examples](./Documentation/PACo%20Examples.md)
  - This canvas app contains a screen for every PACo canvas component or set of related PACo canvas components. This way, you can more easily experiment with the PACo canvas componets to better understand them.

To be able to use PACo canvas components, an experimental feature must be enabled:

- Enhanced component properties (In preview since 2021-02-18)

Please also look at the [Power Platform Creator Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/creator-kit/overview) if you are interested in creating functional and good-looking apps (model-driven and canvas) in less time. The creator kit has many really nice code- and canvas components. It requires an environment with a database and to be able to use code components.

The installation of PACo and PACoCo is described [here](./Documentation/Installation.md).

How to update PACo canvas components in your canvas apps is described [here](./Documentation/How%20to%20update%20PACo%20canvas%20components.md).

How to add the PACo canvas components to your canvas app for this first time is described [here](./Documentation/How%20to%20add%20PACo%20canvas%20components%20to%20your%20canvas%20app%20for%20the%20first%20time.md).

# PACo
PACo is a Power Apps canvas app containing many canvas components to create functional and good-looking canvas apps in less time.

The screenshot below is made from the companion canvas app [PACoCo](./PACoCo.md) which is created with PACo.

To be able to use PACo, two experimental features must be enabled:

- Enhanced component properties (In preview since 2021-02-18)
- ParseJSON function and untyped objects (In preview since 2022-09-12)
  - This feature is not needed when the form canvas component is not used.

Please also look at the [Power Platform Creator Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/creator-kit/overview) if you are interested in creating functional and good-looking apps (model-driven and canvas) in less time. The creator kit includes many code components and a few canvas components. It is required to have an environment with a database and to be able to use code components.

The installation of PACo and PACoCo is described [here](./Installation.md).

The backlog of PACo is [here](https://www.formsandflows.nl/paco-backlog/).

# Components

Each canvas component belongs to a category and has its own documentation file. The documentation is always based on the most recent final version of that canvas component.

The canvas components have been made with being used in responsive canvas apps in mind.

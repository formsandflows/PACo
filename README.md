Creating quality and meaningful canvas components is the main goal of **PACo**.

**PACo** is added with a Power Platform solution (managed or unmanaged) and consists of the main objects:
* The component library **PACo** containing all canvas components.
* The canvas app **[PACo Examples](https://www.formsandflows.nl/redirects/paco-github-paco-examples)** which contains a screen for each canvas component or set of related canvas components. This canvas app makes it easy to experiment with the canvas components and so better understand them.

Each canvas component has a documentation page which can be found in this GitHub repository in the folder "Canvas components".

## Documentation

If **PACo** is useful to you, I would very much appreciate it if you bought me a coffee: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker) üëç

And with that, I wish you a lot of fun creating your business solutions with the Microsoft Power Platform and of course also with **PACo** üòÅüëä

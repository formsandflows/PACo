Updating PACo canvas components is simple:
1. Install/Update PACo in your environment.
2. Edit your canvas app.
In the tree view, go to the tab "Components".
4. Click on the three dots next to "New component" and select "Import components".
5. Select PACo and click on the button "Import".
6. After a few seconds, you get the following message:

7. Click on the button "Replace". After 10 - 20 seconds your PACo canvas components will be updated.
8. Depending on the update, your can/have to make configuration changes to your PACo canvas components.

The steps above must be executed for each canvas app you have used PACo canvas components.

You do not need to have PACo available to keep using the PACo canvas components in your canvas apps. That is why depending on your situation PACo must be installed or updated first before updating your PACo canvas components.

If you want to update only one or a few PACo canvas components, that is possible too. After installing/updating PACo, you need to edit PACo and remove all canvas components except for the ones you want to update. Updating only one or a few PACo canvas components is not recommended. It can lead to canvas apps having a mix of PACo canvas component versions. Such situation will never be tested by the author of PACo. The better approach is to update all PACo canvas components and remove the ones you do not use from your canvas app.

**!! If you have made customizations to the PACo canvas components, you have to make them again.**
